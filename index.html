   HTML, in regard to web development, allows creators to create basic webpages. With HTML, a creator can ensure that a basic webpage has been developed. For instance, a basic index.html file can ensure that the creator has a webpage to develop. HTML provides an empty, or basic, framework for website development. The developer has basic capabilities, in regard to design, with HTML.

   CSS, in regard to web development, gives the web developer access to more design capabilities. Where HTML created a basic webpage, with limited tags, CSS can allow the developer to choose fonts, styles, colors, etc. With CSS, the developer can create a webpage that is representative of their personality, interests, etc. CSS allows a webpage to be designed according to the developer's needs.

  JavaScript, unlike HTML and CSS, provides a different type of functionality. With JavaScript, the developer can create a webpage that the user can enjoy more. With JavaScript, a webpage can become interactive. According to online sources, JavaScript can be described as being a client-side programming language. Where CSS and HTML were in regard to design, Javascript is used for functionality.
