  <b>The Role of HTML</b> 
  <p>
   HTML, in regard to web development, allows creators to create basic webpages. <strong>With HTML, a creator can ensure that a basic webpage has been developed.</strong> For instance, a basic index.html file can ensure that the creator has a webpage to develop. HTML provides an empty, or basic, framework for website development. The developer has basic capabilities, in regard to design, with HTML.

  <b>The Role of CSS</b>
  <br>
  <p>
   CSS, in regard to web development, <strong>gives the web developer access to more design capabilities.</strong> Where HTML created a basic webpage, with limited tags, CSS can allow the developer to choose fonts, styles, colors, etc. With CSS, the developer can create a webpage that is representative of their personality, interests, etc. CSS allows a webpage to be designed according to the developer's needs.
 </p>
 <br>
 <b>The Role of JavaScript </b>
 <br>
 <p>
  JavaScript, unlike HTML and CSS, provides a different type of functionality. <strong>With JavaScript, the developer can create a webpage that the user can enjoy more.</strong> With JavaScript, a webpage can become interactive. According to online sources, JavaScript can be described as being a client-side programming language. Where CSS and HTML were in regard to design, Javascript is used for functionality.
